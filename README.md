# TL-Fuzz

This projects aims to explore guiding graybox fuzzing using instruction-level taint tracing. This project was completed under the Georgia Tech's [President's Undergraduate Research Award](http://www.undergradresearch.gatech.edu/content/presidents-undergraduate-research-awards) (PURA).

For more details, check the [technical report](report.pdf).

Spoiler alert, the experiment turned out to be a failure lol
